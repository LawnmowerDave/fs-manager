# fs-manager

A simple terminal-based filesystem manager for MacOS. It integrates with both SSHFS and OXFS.

Note: This filesystem should also work for Unix-like systems but has not yet been tested for them. 

## Getting started

Start by installing a filesystem manager by running the installer

`./installer.sh`

## Usage

`add-mount` - Add a mountpoint using the filesystem of your choosing.

`mount-all` - Mount all filesystems.

`unmount-all` - Unmount all filesystems.

`active-mounts` - List all currently mounted filesystems.
